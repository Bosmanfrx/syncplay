Watching videos with friends and commenting them live on IRC or Mumble\r\n1. Do something for lulz and to learn new stuff\r\n\r\n## What does it do\r\n\r\nIt synchronizes many media players, so many people can watch the same movie at the same moment.\r\nWhen one person pauses playback, it gets paused in all players. When one person seeks,\r\nall players seek to the same position. When new person joins to the watching session which\r\nruns for a while, his player starts playback at the moment where other people are.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nAll you need is Python 2.7 and Twisted to run python scripts.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nBecause setting up Python and installing requirements under Windows is a bit hard,\r\nI'll provide download links to \"ready to use\" package when it gets stable.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to run it from sources, apart from Python and Twisted you'll\r\nprobably need to instal manually setuptools and zope.interface packages. Additionaly\r\nyou can install py2exe to make \"all in one\" redistributable package.\r\n\r\n## Supported players\r\n\r\n### Mplayer\r\n\r\n`sync_mplayer` acts as a wrapper for mplayer. First two arguments are host and nickname.\r\nThe rest are arguments to be given to mplayer (at least filename). It launches mplayer\r\nwhich behaves just like normal (it reacts to keyboard shortcuts etc).\r\n\r\nDefault mplayer output is suppressed, but if mplayer quits with errors, those errors\r\nwill be printed (at most 50 last lines).\r\n\r\n### Media Player Classic Home Cinema (MPC-HC)\r\n\r\n`sync_mpc` connects to MPC via its Web Interface. You need to enable it first in settings\r\n(check \"Listen on port\" with default port which is 13579 and to be more secure check\r\n\"Allow access from localhost only\"). You need to run MPC and open the file first, then launch syncplay.\r\n\r\nYou need to provide two argument to `sync_mpc`: hostname to conect to and nickname.\r\nIf hostname and nickname doesn not change, you can create shortcut to executable somewhere, edit it\r\nand append those two arguments to command.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\nYou need to run `run_sync_server` somewhere. If you have public IP, you can try to launch server on your computer\r\nand give your friends your IP number, so they can connect to it. It will listen at port 8999, you\r\nmight need to allow connections to it in your firewall/router.\r\n\r\nThen you launch player synchronization. When it connects and doesn't print errors about player, you are ready.\r\nWhen all interested people join, you can just unpause in and it will just start to play everywhere.\r\n\r\n"}
